# 🚀 90 Days DevOps & Cloud Engineering Journey

## Plan for the Next 90 Days

For the next 90 days, I will focus on learning DevOps and Cloud Engineering while consistently sharing content related to DevOps.

The goal is not just to learn tools, but to understand how modern software systems are built, deployed, scaled, and maintained in real-world production environments.

## What is DevOps?

DevOps is a culture and set of practices that combine software development and IT operations to deliver applications faster, more reliably, and with greater automation.

It focuses on breaking down silos between development and operations teams to ensure smooth collaboration and continuous delivery.

### Core Areas of DevOps:

* Continuous Integration / Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)
* Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
* Monitoring and Logging
* Automation
* Collaboration and shared responsibility

### Common DevOps Tools:

* Git
* Docker
* Kubernetes
* Jenkins
* Terraform
* Ansible

In simple words:

**DevOps is about how we deliver software efficiently, reliably, and at scale.**

## Why DevOps?

As a developer, I realized that writing code is only 50% of the product journey.

Deployment, scalability, monitoring, security, and reliability are equally important.

I want to understand the complete lifecycle of an application — from development to production.

DevOps and Cloud Engineering give me control over infrastructure, automation, scalability, and system reliability. This makes me a more complete and powerful engineer.

## What is Cloud Engineering?

Cloud Engineering involves designing, building, and managing cloud-based infrastructure to support scalable, secure, and high-performing applications.

Cloud engineers work with platforms such as:

* AWS
* Azure
* Google Cloud Platform (GCP)

They select appropriate service models like:

* IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service)
* PaaS (Platform as a Service)
* SaaS (Software as a Service)

### Core Responsibilities:

* Architecting scalable cloud solutions
* Deploying virtual machines, storage, and networking
* Implementing auto-scaling and load balancing
* Optimizing performance and cost
* Ensuring security through encryption and access controls
* Managing compliance and monitoring

### Key Skills:

* Infrastructure as Code tools (Terraform, CloudFormation)
* Scripting (Python, Bash)
* Containers (Docker, Kubernetes)
* Monitoring and logging tools
* Cloud networking and security fundamentals

Cloud engineers ensure reliable cloud environments that enable modern DevOps practices.

## Cloud Engineering in DevOps

Cloud Engineering plays a foundational role in DevOps by providing scalable and reliable infrastructure that enables automated software delivery.

### Role in DevOps Practices:

* Provisioning infrastructure using Infrastructure as Code
* Supporting CI/CD pipelines
* Enabling container orchestration with Kubernetes
* Implementing monitoring systems like Prometheus and Grafana
* Ensuring high availability and fault tolerance

### Key Integration Areas:

**Deployment Support**
Cloud infrastructure enables blue-green and canary deployment strategies for zero-downtime releases.

**Monitoring & Scaling**
Real-time monitoring and auto-scaling prevent performance bottlenecks in production systems.

**Security & Compliance**
Infrastructure-level controls integrate with DevOps pipelines for automated security checks.

This synergy has led to modern hybrid roles such as “Cloud DevOps Engineer,” focused on both infrastructure and automation.

## My Goal for These 90 Days

* Build strong fundamentals in Linux, networking, and Git
* Learn Docker and containerization deeply
* Understand Kubernetes architecture
* Implement CI/CD pipelines
* Work with Terraform for Infrastructure as Code
* Deploy real applications on cloud platforms
* Document and share daily learning consistently
